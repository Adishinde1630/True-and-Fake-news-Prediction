# True vs Fake News Prediction

This Jupyter Notebook implements a simple text-classification pipeline to predict whether news is true or fake using classical ML models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Bagging).

Getting started

- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Open the notebook `True Fake News Prediction.ipynb` and run the cells in order.

Notes

- The dataset CSVs (`True.csv`, `fake.csv`) are expected alongside the notebook.
- The notebook downloads some NLTK data on first run.

If you want me to push this repo to GitHub, provide the repository URL (HTTPS) or grant access/token and I'll add the remote and push.
